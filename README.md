## Concept Process üí°

**I took a lot of inspiration froma concept i saw previously from a company that showcased one of their ideas for an app they had developed early this year, the app was a hands on childs healthcare VR and AR setup where kids in hospitals could use VR to visit a virtual island where animals taught them about their diseases and the problems they were having, i found the app to be very inuitive, the UX and UI was just so inspiring i had to put it to the test and see what i could develop myself!**

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

***Attitude over aptitude*** 

### Implementation Process ‚åõ

<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

- Implementation started in the third week of the term when i knew the project i wanted to create and the void i knew i wanted to fill in the market of healthcare and education 

### Peer review report üìù

**These are some of the findings i made during my feedback session**

### Future Implementation üîÆ

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- **I would love to include some additional AI implementation, giving the kids thea ability to have a more hands on approach with a bot**
- **Fine tune the API and fine tune the model even more to create a more kid friendly environment**
- **I also saw a great option for a friendly & formal bot, and the ability to switch between the two from a classmate of mine that would be really cool to implement**
- **I would really like a simply pop up modal for character and avatar selection instead of choosing from your pc**
- **Implementing some Lottie animations could definately add to the user friendly interface and childrens appeal to the app**
