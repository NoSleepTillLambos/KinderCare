- Home page, users are introduced to the app and can then move to the create entry screen where they can enter into a cocktail comp and compete

### Feature 3

![image7](assets/mockups/createEntry.JPG)

- Users can create a cocktail entry by uploading the details and an image of their creation, along with some details about the ingredients and other important information so users can try the recipes at home for themselves!
- Users being able to try the cocktails out is the entire premise of the app, teaching keen learners a new hobbie!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process üí°

**I took a lot of inspiration froma concept i saw previously from a company that showcased one of their ideas for an app they had developed early this year, the app was a hands on childs healthcare VR and AR setup where kids in hospitals could use VR to visit a virtual island where animals taught them about their diseases and the problems they were having, i found the app to be very inuitive, the UX and UI was just so inspiring i had to put it to the test and see what i could develop myself!**

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

***Attitude over aptitude*** 

### Implementation Process ‚åõ

<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

- Implementation started in the third week of the term when i knew the project i wanted to create and the void i knew i wanted to fill in the market of healthcare and education 

### Peer review report üìù

**These are some of the findings i made during my feedback session**

### Future Implementation üîÆ

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- I would love to include some additional AI implementation, giving the kids thea ability to have a more hands on approach with a bot
- Fine tune the API and fine tune the model even more to create a more kid friendly environment
- I also saw a great option for a friendly & formal bot, and the ability to switch between the two from a classmate of mine that would be really cool to implement
